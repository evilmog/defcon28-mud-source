Q: What do I do now that I have this stuff?
A:   Take a look at the doc dir.  You'll need to install things
   (read doc/INSTALLING)
   Then startup the mud
   Then login as someone (the first player will be an admin)   
   You will also probably want to look at the lib/doc directory

Q: When I run startmud it returns with no errors what do I do?
A: Look at lib/logs/gurba-driver.log

Q: When trying to start the mud, it complains about the file
   local_config.h not being there and then terminates.
A: You didn't follow the directions for configuring the mud and
   installing the driver. read and follow doc/INSTALLING
	(Note: This has changed use to be called mudname.h, if your
	getting this problem now reread INSTALLING and send me an email
	if your still having problems.)

Q: When starting the mud, I get output like this:

  Mar 10 13:00:16 ** DGD 1.2.157-NET-05 running GurbaLib v0.41.

  Config error: initialization failed

A: The file lib/kernel/include/local_config.h does not define the
   IMUD_NAME macro, probably because you created an empty file
   there or removed that macro. 

Q: I changed the Makefile to build dgd with -O or -O2 and now it crashes.
A: Don't do this. It is not supported and the possible gain it
   could give is very small.

Q: I upgraded my mudlib, and now things don't work, what do I do?
A: Look at doc/UPGRADING
