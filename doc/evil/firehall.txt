   This office was once used to facilitate the record-keeping
   of the North Dome's residents. Now, with the advent of a

   records obsolete, this office has fallen into disuse and
   has been abandoned and forgotten.

the last attacks happened.  It may require some careful exploration, as
the rabbit hasn't been recorded on any of the Enforcement newsvids of
either the Sewers or the main atriums in the City complex.  The rabbit must
