Welcome to the EvilMog Branch (Dustin Heywood) of the Sirdude's(aka Kent Mein)
branch of the Gurbalib mudlib.

An lpmud mudlib for the DGD driver.

---BEGIN MOG---
This branch has been heavily modified from the sirdude branch to include
MXP, GMCP, Disable Magic and mess with the game balance for DEFCON 28.

I strongly recommend using a tool like beyond compare to check the
differences from mainline gurba.

Special thanks to Dave Shay for the loan of the Coremud.org areas, as
I do not have the rights to that content I have ensured it was removed
from the open source release.

--- Begin Kent---
I played on various muds in my college years and am a UNIX Sys Admin.  
I've been playing lots of minecraft with my kids lately and want them
to get into UNIX and programming.  So I started tinkering with muds
again.  I downloaded DGD and went in pursuit of a mudlib.

If you are reading this you probably have had a similar quest and have
found that the stuff that is out there is old, sparse, not fully
functional and or some mixture of the above.

All the documentation I found stated if you want to get a mud running
quickly with DGD go with gurba at this point.  It's basically ready to
run.

So I grabbed what I could and gave it a shot.  After a couple of
months of playing with things, I think I have a pretty good handle on
where things are at.  I don't like everything about the mudlib but
its a great start and something to move forward with.

My goals are to simplify things, make a consistent, well documented,
functional mudlib that anyone can use as a base for a mud.

If you're just getting started with this, take a look at the following
things in this order:
	doc/INSTALLING 
	the other documents in doc
	the documentation in lib/doc
	basically everything in lib since that is the important stuff.
