As you get a closer look at the creature, you realize that Y06617A was once
HUMAN. The facial frame, the inner exoframe of its hulking size, the all
too-human eyes...

You leave this place, unable to stomach the dead corpse lying on the
ground, its blood on your hands. Nor can you stand the claustrophobic feel
of these steam rooms anymore. In fact, you want to just leave this forsaken
area and never return again.

   Hydro Generator #4

   Towering high above you in this big room are large transparent tubes
   filled with water. The falling water is turning a waterwheel in each
   tube which generates gerks for the City via power generators. You
   realize that the water in the tubes actually come from the sewer
   system of the City.

   The only exit is located to the south.

Exits: south

   Generator Corridor

   This clean and bright corridor is a brief respite from the darkness
   and unholy stench of the sewers outside the hydro generator complex.
   Blue stripes in the middle of the walls provide a soft blue glow
   which seems to have a peaceful and serene quality about it.

   To your north, a large metal arch leads into one of the hydro
   generators. To your south is a hub of the generator complex.

Exits: south, north

You look back at the hydro generator room and shudder, thoughts of your
battle with the nightmarish creature in the steamrooms below still all too
clear in your mind. It's been long and hard, but the hunt is finally over.
Deciding to forget this grisly affair forever, you continue on with your
life in Core. But somehow, you feel that things just won't be the same
again for you anymore...
