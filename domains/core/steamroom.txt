   Entrance To Steam Rooms

   You are in a small enclosed room with glass walls. Outside, you can
   see nothing but steam beyond the walls. This appears to be some sort
   of boiler room beneath the hydroelectric generators, but you don't
   see any signs of such a boiler save for the steam all around. Somehow
   you don't feel safe in this area.

   You may return to the hydroelectric generators above by going up.
   Otherwise, exits to the west, southeast and southwest lead to outside
   the relative safety of this glass-enclosed room.

   A panel here reads: Safety Locks Engaged
   Apparently, only one person can be in the steam rooms at a time.

Exits: west, up, southwest, southeast

   Steam Room

   There appears to be steam filling up the entire place, but you can't
   determine where it's coming from. A million shadows move in the
   light of the shifting steam, and you have no way to know which is
   real and which is not.

   Steam Room

   You try your best to look around you, but thick steam from
   around are hindering your vision. It's hot, and you can't
   help but feel so enclosed and enveloped by the thick steam.

   Steam Room

   A dark room filled with steam can be a dangerous place. You have no
   idea what's wandering around here, and you can't even see beyond a few
   feet in this thick steamy mist. Anything can ambush you, and you might
   not know anything about it until you're dead.

   Steam Room

   The thick steam envelopes you like a heavy fog, damping you slightly
   while making you feel uncomfortably warm. It's like something is
   boiling a huge kettle of water here. Visibility is very very low, as
   you can hardly see your hands in front of you.

   Steam Room

   You can't see much of anything, only the abundant steam flowing all
   over your body. Lights are present, but they've been too distorted by
   the huge amount of vapour to make any sense. All they do is cause you
   to see strange shadows moving around you.

   Steam Room

   There seems to be a weird goatish smell in the air, but with the thick
   suffocating mist all around you, you can't really be sure. What's more
   you know that the steam's hot and humid conditions tend to overheat
   the mind, making you imagine things.

   Steam Room

   Indistinguishable sounds echo all around you, their original locations
   lost to you by the acoustic and visual interference of the thick misty
   steam. Shadows flit mysteriously in the shifting light. You can't tell
   if it's your imagination or if it's for real.
